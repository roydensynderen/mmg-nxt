        <div className="homeBgFull__p">Your DNA is the blueprint of life. It determines everything from how you look to how you behave. Understanding your DNA gives you the ability to make better decisions in life by focusing on specific skillsets and personalized disease prevention rather than taking on the “one-sized-fits-all” approach from disease prevention to personal talent development.
